# MyWeather App

MyWeather is an Android application that provides real-time weather updates and forecasts for your current location or any city worldwide. The app is developed using Kotlin, XML, and leverages WeatherAPI for fetching weather data.


## Features

### 1. Current Weather Display
- **Real-time Updates**: MyWeather delivers accurate and up-to-date weather information for your current location. It displays the current temperature, weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy), humidity levels, wind speed, and UV index. The app also shows how the temperature feels (feels-like temperature) based on wind and humidity.
- **Visual Representation**: The app includes weather icons that visually represent the current conditions (e.g., a sun icon for clear skies or a cloud with rain icon for rainy conditions).

### 2. Hourly Weather Forecast
- **Detailed Hourly Data**: MyWeather provides an hourly breakdown of weather conditions for the entire day. This feature allows users to see temperature changes, precipitation chances, and other weather details on an hour-by-hour basis.
- **Scrollable Interface**: Users can scroll horizontally through the hourly forecast to view weather predictions for each hour of the day, helping them plan their activities with precision.

### 3. Extended Multi-Day Forecast
- **Multi-Day Forecast**: The app offers an extended weather forecast that spans several days into the future. This feature provides users with minimum and maximum temperatures, expected weather conditions, and other relevant data for each day.
- **Future Planning**: This functionality is handy for users who need to plan, such as scheduling outdoor events or trips, by providing insight into upcoming weather trends.

### 4. Location-Based Weather
- **Automatic Location Detection**: MyWeather uses your device’s GPS to automatically detect your current location and provide localized weather updates without the need for manual input.
- **Manual Search Option**: Besides automatic location detection, users can manually search for weather information in any city or region globally. This feature is ideal for checking the weather in multiple locations, such as when traveling.

### 5. Search Functionality
- **City and Location Search**: The app includes a search bar integrated into the toolbar, allowing users to quickly find weather information for any city around the world. Enter the city name, and MyWeather will fetch the relevant weather data.
- **Seamless User Experience**: The search functionality is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, making it simple for users to switch between different locations and view the corresponding weather information.

### 6. User-Friendly Interface
- **Interactive Elements**: MyWeather’s interface is designed with user interaction in mind. Key elements, such as weather details and forecasts, are easily accessible. The app also includes clickable links, such as an author link that directs users to the developer's website.
- **Edge-to-Edge Support**: The app is optimized for modern Android devices, supporting edge-to-edge screen layouts. This ensures that the app’s content is displayed beautifully on devices with minimal bezels, providing an immersive user experience.
